After unzipping the folder to C:/Xampp/htdocs/:
    - Open PhpMyAdmin in the browser and create a database with name "hospital_mgmt_sys"
    - Select the database you created (hospital_mgmt_sys)
    - Press Import in the PhpMyAdmin and import file name "hospital_mgmt_sys.sql" in this folder
    - Open browser and go to http://localhost/Hospital-MGMT-SYS/.

Thank you!
